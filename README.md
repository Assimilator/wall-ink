# Introduction
Wall-ink was architected from the ground up to be an enterprise friendly, secure, and completely open solution to display room schedules at a University.  The product could however be used to display other images for advertising, directions, staff directories, retail pricing, etc.

The original design parameters were to display a room schedule electronically with no wires, at cheapest possible price point.  No Ethernet, no power wires, in a low-cost footprint.  The resulting project has produced a AA powered WiFi E-ink device for under $100 (US), where the batteries last a year or two.  


The wall-ink project along with the [Wall-Ink-Server](https://github.com/caedm/wall-ink-server) include everything necessary to build the entire e-ink display system 
 
# Summary
The wall-ink project has several components

* Circuit and electronics, including Eagle schematic, PCB layout and gerber files
* List of necessary parts to build the project
* Arduino IDE Firmware for the ESP8266 microcontroller
* CAD files to 3D print case for the sign
* See the [Wall-Ink-Server](https://github.com/caedm/wall-ink-server) project project for server side code
